        My name is Jessica Zelasky. I am a recent graduate of the University of Connecticut and currently seeking a position as a full stack web developer. I am currently located in Eastern CT, but am looking to relocate in the next few months. In my free time I enjoy reading, crafting, and spending time with my dog.
